# CS 731 Project Group 4

The name of this Social Media Platform is called FriendLoop.

This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) program for developing a social media platform. The goal of this project is to create a web-based application that allows users to create accounts, post media content, interact with posts through up-voting and down-voting, and make comments.

## Features
The social media platform will provide the following functionality:

**Account Creation:** Users can create accounts to access the platform.

**Login and Logout:** Users can securely log in and log out of their accounts.

**Post Media Content:** Users can create posts by uploading images and adding text descriptions.

**Display Posts:** The platform will display posts in a user-friendly manner, showcasing the media content and associated information.

**Up-voting and Down-voting:** Users can express their preference for posts by up-voting or down-voting them.

**Comments:** Users can engage in conversations by commenting on posts.
